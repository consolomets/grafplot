Python project for plotting undirected graph(s) from .csv file.

The CSV file should contain columns `Parent` and `Child` describing
edges. Optionally it may also include `BackgroundColor` and `FontColor`
columns for styling individual nodes. When these columns are missing
the default black text on white background is used.
